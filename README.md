Just got back from 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Kimge Kereksin, and wow, my brain feels like it's been through a blender. You know that feeling when you leave a   and you're trying to piece together how you feel about it but you're also thinking about what's for dinner? That's me right now. This   — where do I even start? Felt like riding a rollercoaster that was built without safety standards.

Okay, let's break this down — first, the visuals are stunning, like, they're really trying to drown you in all these colors and...

soul? Texture? Or maybe they're just distracting me from the storyline that feels like it's been quickly stitched together by a group of sleep-deprived artists. Yet, somehow, I'm not mad about it. 

The characters are like these half-drawn sketches, you kinda want to meet them at a bar and figure out who they are. Or not, because they might end up just speaking in riddles and leave you with an existential crisis over your pint.

> This one scene, for the love of popcorn, I swear it felt like living in a Dali painting. Everything's melting... including my patience. The pacing? Oh, heavens.

But it got under my skin, and not in a creepy horror-𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮-kind-of-way but more like a persistent itch you can't reach. There's a charm in its messiness, like how a child smiles at you through a face absolutely covered in ice cream.

Sometimes I wonder if the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was just a way for the director to express the chaos in their head. Oh, hey, if they wanted me to feel tangled emotions and question the essence of existence and why we bother with anything — mission accomplished. 

Here's a weird thing I found myself thinking: If Kimge Kereksin was a dish, it'd be that over-ambitious meal you try cooking from a YouTube video, looks like a wreck, but somehow tastes... okay? Works in mysterious ways, as they say. 

By the way, can we talk about that ending? What even was that? Was it metaphorical? Does it matter? Maybe just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   because you’re either gonna love it or just sit there with your cup of endless confusion.

```c
int main() {
    printf(Do people really change? Why?);
    return 0;
}
```

What's left to say? Talk about a scrambled egg for the brain. Maybe I didn’t “get” all of it but honestly, I don't need to. Kimge Kereksin is like an unpredictable weather pattern that left me a bit soaked, guessing if I should curse the sky or be thankful I’m alive to feel it. Now excuse me while I try to find that last, infuriatingly catchy song stuck in my head.
